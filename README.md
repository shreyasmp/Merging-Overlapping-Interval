## Background

Venue Visitors: Merchants may want to know some analytics about who is visiting their venue. We want to show the people who have visited, and the time that their venue is idle. We’d like to build something to show the people at a venue (*sorted by arrival time*) filling in the gaps for open to close.

You will need to write a small algorithm to find idle intervals where no visitor is present at the venue.  *Your solution should include a comment in your code with a brief description of how your algorithm works, a discussion of any trade-offs or assumptions you made in your design, and an analysis of its running time* (hint: you can do better than O(n²), where n is the number of visitors).
